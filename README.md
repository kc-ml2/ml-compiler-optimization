## prerequisites

system

pip packages

`requirements.txt`

## Encoder
![img.png](pics/img.png)

Transform hetergeneous graph to homogeneous graph, 

by embedding **node/edge types** in Euclidean space

**Node identifiers** are translated to integer by vocabulary dictionary(`vocab.json` from https://zenodo.org/record/4247595).

**Edge positions** are embedded by positional embedding from original Transformer.


## RL 

Actor-Critic, and the loss is

PPOv2(clipped gradient version) with shared/unshared encoder.

Model updated in asynchronous manner.

Each `benchmark` is an _episode_, episodes are aligned(rolled out) in parallel, as much as our resource allows.

This is to remove temporal correlation(just like what replay memory does) 

## notes
since every implementations differ from each other little bit,

implemented with 3 versions

1. from scratch `_rl2` 
2. rllib `rllib*.py` - distributed computing
3. some PPO impl. from github `PPO-PyTorch` - someone from leaderboard refered to it
